Suppose I have a restaurant app for Android, 12 RecyclerViews called MenuPage with each a GridLayoutManager of 8 rows with up to 20 items scrolling in horizontal direction. Each item shows a Name (food) and price. GridLayoutManager is just an idea, not a requirement.

Each MenuPage has a height, which is the same as minimum(tablet resolution-X, tablet resolution-Y). The PageName is 1/8 of this height. The Width of a MenuItem is decided by the user per MenuPage, this is received over GRPC from the server (already working).

Above each menuPage I want a button with the name, called PageName. The PageNames are always visible, the MenuPages can be hidden (or deleted, later rendered again).

Since MenuPages and PageNames don't fit on one screen, this is a very high LinearLayout (or other) with vertically the MenuPages and PageNames. All the MenuPages are hidden at start. So we only see 12 PageNames above each other with hidden MenuPages below each PageName. 

When I click the PageName, the MenuPage appears below the PageName in a fluent animation. When I click the PageName again, the MenuPage will hide again.

When I click another PageName the other MenuPage will appear below its PageName. When we have too many MenuPages open, we should consider closing some MenuPages. In that case,  they will hide gracefully and one MenuPage becomes visible quickly.

In the end, the waiter should be able to quickly place an order and select the items required for the customer. Also, the phone or tablet has limited space to show all the items, so we should optimize close and open the MenuPages.

How to do this in Kotlin?
