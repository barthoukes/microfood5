POS solution for a tablet in a GRPC network
I develop this in my local PC, sometimes update this to Github. It's a good example for:
* Layouts
* POS
* Using GRPC communication between C++ and Kotlin.

Examples of our project are not available yet. However, the main project in C++ is working in many restaurants across the Netherlands.
When this app is more mature, it can be added to these restaurants.
You can also make your own cash register software in any language and add this project for the remote part. Be sure that you use the proto files as layer between the programs.
